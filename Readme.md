Hi, I am an aspiring full stack machine learning engineer. My end goal is to leverage the learning power of machine learning algorithms to develop full fledged software products that can improvise through experience. I am currently exploring the machine learning domain through simple or super ambitious or over-curiosity experiments to get myself familiared with the latest advancements.
